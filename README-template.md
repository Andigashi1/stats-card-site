## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned a bit of working with positioning images and divs with css insted of html which i always did. The overlaying part was hard for me because it was a first but everything else was fun to do.

### Continued development

Want to focus more on learning css overall and will start learning js after.
